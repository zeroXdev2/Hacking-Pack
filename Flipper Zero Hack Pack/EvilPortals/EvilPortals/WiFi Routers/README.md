# !!FOR EDUCATIONAL USES ONLY!!
These portals are made to emulate a "router setup WiFi". Could be used in a situation where a WiFi gets deauthed and the users are trying to find the reason they don't have internet. They would think they need to connect to this new portal with their router's brand and give their WiFi creds to update their machine.  

## I only made this to show the capabilities. I mean it when I say this is not meant to be used on real victims, you would be an a**hole if you do it

## Happy flippin'
