This one **emulates a portal for a KLM "Free Hotspot"** using EvilPortal on your Flipper Zero.
KLM is the Dutch national airline. Not like they would give you anything for free anyway.

The **HTML in the *"WithForgotCredentials"* file** contains a **"forgot credentials" button on the user side to make it look more realistic**. This button only shows a message inviting them to go on their provider's app if they forgot their login/password.
## Happy flippin'
